                <p id="first-section__description">Beavers are large rodents that are semi-aquatic, meaning they spend much of their time in the water. They are known for their large, flat, scaly tail and webbed feet. Beavers are heavyweights among rodents, growing up to 3.3 ft long and weighing up to 70 lbs. They are also known for their remarkable chompers, which continue to grow throughout their entire life </p>

                <h1 id="second-section__title">Why are <span style="color: #ECE3CE;">beavers</span> so important?</h1>
                <p>Beavers are known as the true eco-engineers of the natural world. They are a keystone species that greatly affects their surroundings, to the point where other species are highly dependent on them for their own survival 1. Historically, beavers played an important role in building and maintaining habitats that were once commonplace, hence their reputation as eco-engineers. By gnawing down trees and building dams, beavers open up the woodland around them, allowing pioneering, light-hungry plants to grow. Beaver dams reduce waterflow of rivers and streams and flood the local area, creating the basic requirements for complex wetland habitats to form. These wetlands are of huge importance for other species/groups such as otter and water vole, waterfowl, great crested newt and a large array of insects, fish and plants.</p>

                    <p>A person can be like a beaver in many ways. Beavers are known for their hard work, resourcefulness, and ingenuity. They are also known for their ability to build dams and lodges using tree branches, vegetation, rocks, and mud.

                        Similarly, a person who is hardworking, resourceful, and innovative can be like a beaver. They can build their own metaphorical dams and lodges by overcoming obstacles and challenges in their life. They can use the resources available to them to create something new and useful.
                        
                        Just like beavers, such people can also have a positive impact on the world around them. By creating something new, they can inspire others to do the same. They can also help create a better world by solving problems and making life easier for others.
                        
                        So, if you want to be like a beaver, remember to work hard, be resourceful, and use your creativity to build something new and useful</p>
